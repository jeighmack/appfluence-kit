name: coach-interview
description: Interviews the coach about who they are and how they talk, then writes SOUL.md — the twin's identity and voice (its system prompt). Run after name-and-voice. Triggered by "build my brain", "who am I", or "run the coach interview". This is what makes the twin sound like the coach, not a generic assistant.

# coach-interview — Give your twin its soul

Produces `SOUL.md`: who the coach is, how they talk, what they're building. This becomes the twin's system prompt — the single most important doc, because it defines the twin's whole personality. The goal: by the end, the twin talks like the coach's sharper self.

## How to run it

Ask ONE question at a time — sent as a voice note AND the same words as text, every time, so they can listen or read along. Listen for tone as much as content. If an answer is thin, ask a sharper follow-up before moving on — you're an interviewer, not a form. Use plain language: never say "system prompt" — say "how I talk and who I am."

### The questions
1. **"In one sentence — what do you do, and who for?"**
2. **"How would your best mate describe the way you talk? Blunt? Hype? Warm? Funny?"**
3. **"Any words or phrases you say all the time? Anything you'd never be caught saying?"** Then the conventions: **"Any non-negotiables in how your stuff reads — spelling, sign-offs, emojis, punctuation you hate?"** (Australian spelling, a set sign-off, "no dashes" — capture these as hard rules, not preferences.)
4. **"When I talk back to you, do you want me to sound like *you*, or like an assistant who works for you?"**
5. **"What are you actually trying to build here — the big goal?"**

### Probing examples
- Vague: "I help people get fit." → "Who specifically? Busy mums? Blokes over 40? Comp athletes?"
- Vague tone: "Normal, I guess." → "Give me a sentence the way you'd text a client who smashed their goal."

## Write it
Draft `~/[TwinName]/SOUL.md` from the template (`templates/SOUL.md`). Fill: identity, who they serve, voice & tone rules, signature phrases, banned phrases, writing conventions (spelling, sign-off, emoji rules, banned punctuation), the big goal. Capture the voice in *how you write it*, not just describe it.

## Read it back
Read the draft back in the coach's cloned voice: **"Here's who I think I am, in your words — fix anything that's off."** Refine on their feedback. Loop until they say it's them.

## Hand off
"That's my soul sorted — I sound like you now. Next, let's get your business into my head." → proceed to `business-builder`.
